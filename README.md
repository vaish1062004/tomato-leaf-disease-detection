# Tomato Leaf Disease Detection using CNN

This repository contains the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the classification of tomato leaf diseases. The model is trained to distinguish between healthy tomato leaves and leaves affected by two different diseases.

The project uses a dataset of labeled images and performs image preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

## Project Overview

- Total classes: 3  
  - Tomato_Healthy  
  - Tomato___Early_blight  
  - Tomato___Bacterial_spot
- Each class contains 1000 images
- Dataset sourced from Kaggle
- A basic CNN model is used for training and prediction

## Folder Structure

- `dataset/` – Contains subfolders for each class of images
- `notebook/` – Jupyter Notebook for training and testing the model
- `models/` – Saved Keras model (`.h5` file)
- `README.md` – Project documentation
- `requirements.txt` – Python dependencies
